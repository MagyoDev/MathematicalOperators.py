# Explanation:

The code prompts the user to input two numbers, N1 and N2, and converts these inputs into floating-point numbers using float(input()).

Then, it performs several mathematical operations:

<p>sum: Adds N1 and N2.</p>
<p>sub: Subtracts N2 from N1.</p>
<p>mul: Multiplies N1 and N2.</p>
<p>div: Divides N1 by N2.</p>
<p>div2: Performs integer division (floor division) of N1 by N2.</p>
<p>pot: Raises N1 to the power of N2.</p>
<p>rest: Finds the remainder of N1 divided by N2.</p>
<p>Finally, it prints the results of these operations with two decimal places using string formatting with format().</p>
